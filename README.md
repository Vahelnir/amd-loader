# AMDLoader

AMDLoader (name is obviously not final) is a library meant to be use as an AMD module loader.
It was originaly created to load named modules bundled into a single file, but will probably grow as a fully functionnal AMD module loader.

/!\ Currently in development, bugs are to be expected
